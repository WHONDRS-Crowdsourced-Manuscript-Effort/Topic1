- the written notes list the U-M distance as 5m (should be 10m). and D-M distance as 10m (should be 5m).
- access to sunlight: D and M have no shade (0% shading and 100% sunlight. instead of 100% canopy cover). The upstream site (U) has about 50% shading. 
Pictures: given the turbidity of the water. no pictures of the sediment could be taken. Sediments were collected by diving down into the water and scooping up sediment. The pictures uploaded represent the setting on land. not in the river. Sediment samples at D and M were fairly muddy. several sediment scoops at the upstream site contained a fair amount of leaves that were removed. 
Filter: the filter clogged after running the second set of replicates and at that point. we switched to the second filter (keeping the first filter clean). Filtering became difficult quickly again and filling vial ICR3 was challenging. When collecting samples for the third replicate for cations (CAT3). the sample collapsed (air might have gotten into the filter?) and water passed through the filter much more easily. We continued sampling CAT3. but the sample is much darker in color. indicating that the filter didn't work. and I suggest to discard that sample. We continued to filter the 125mL vial at the very end (S19S_0011_MER). After a little while. the filtering became harder again. so we discarded the water in it. filtered some more (~10mL). rinsed the bottle with that water and discarded it. and then filtered the required ~125mL. Thus. that sample *may* be valid. Given the above issues with filter #2. we preserved the first filter for microbial analyses with RNALater. "

","Weather was clear and sunny at the time of sampling.  The creek was very turbid due to rains the previous day.  

For the third 4-mL zero head space sample. the bottom of the glass vial cracked and fell off when screwing the lid onto the vial.  The sample was lost.

We were able to use one filter for most of the filtered water samples and had to change filters after filtering ~30 mL sample into the 125 mL PETG bottle.  It was not possible to filter an additional 700 mL through that filter."

The SpC is high at low flow conditions when the dam isn't releasing water. Much of the high SpC is due to high salinity effluent from a waste treatment plant that is several km downstream from the sampling site but upstream of the site 12 km from the dam where published studies have been conducted.

I have extensive experience working in the upper 20 km of the Lower Colorado downstream from Longhorn Dam. and can confirm that the conditions at our sampling site are representative of the river conditions near the USGS gauge. There are no major inflows between the sampling site and the USGS gauge so river conditions at the gauge are also representative of conditions at the sampling site.
