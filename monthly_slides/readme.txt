Fill me monthly with new slides
- on the first of each month starting on December 1st please drop a single slide into the collaboration channel of slack and your topicâ€™s GitHub repository with progress to date. Please include the question being pursued. These slides are meant to keep the leadership team as well as other topic teams in the loop with ongoing analyses. 
- Put each new version of the slide(s) into this folder and name according to the date the file was created. This allows the history of figure/analysis plans to be easily tracked.
