# WHONDRS Core-Satellite crowdsourcing manuscripts: Topic 1

This is the repository for a crowdsourced manuscript based on the WHONDRS summer 2019 data. Our team will create the first manuscript of a series in a special issue in Frontiers in Waters.

## Script 'ownership'
Please use this Github to share scripts and collaborate on the code together.
Make sure to sign-off your name in the script with your initials. People are invited to work on the same scripts (Github keeps the version history of files), however, when pushing and merging edits to the main branch make sure to ask for review and merge permission from the author.

## Code of conduct (in prep)
We are committed to the principles of inclusive, supportive and respectful interactions between project participants. By participating in this project you agree to:

- Respect and value the contribution of participants with different lived experience and perspectives
- Provide space for others to contribute ideas and questions, recognizing that people who find it easy to claim such space to share their opinions should be the first to step back sometimes and provide space for others
- Work to actively include other participants, realizing that many marginalized groups can be excluded (albeit often unintentionally) without conscious effort
- Arrive with the assumption that all participants have good intentions
- Never ever, engage in harassing or discriminatory behaviour and understand that such behaviour may lead to your removal from the project.
